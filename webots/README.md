# Webots simulations

You need a dataset which can be generated from the simulation by using [dataset_generation.wbt](./object_recognition_project/worlds/dataset_generation.wbt).

The developed object detection approach is validated in Webots simulation [vision_pick_and_place.wbt](./object_recognition_project/worlds/vision_pick_and_place.wbt).
