# AMROPick_vision python module

This folder will contain the stand-alone python package of the AMROPick Vision System.

Based on the experiments so far, the object detection method should be based on an approach with multiple processing stages which is illustrated in [predict-yolov8-multiple-stages.ipynb](../AI/predict-yolov8-multiple-stages.ipynb).
